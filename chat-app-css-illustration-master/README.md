### What I learned

During the work on this project, I gained an understanding of the principles of adaptive design and effective use of media queries. Changing the structure and styles according to screen sizes allows for an optimal appearance and interaction with the website on different devices.

Using grid containers allowed me to create a flexible and responsive grid for placing elements on the page. This allows for adjusting the positioning and size of elements based on design needs and screen size.

Animation through CSS keyframes proved to be a powerful tool for creating lively and attractive effects on the page. Using different animation stages and changing properties of objects creates a sense of movement and dynamics.

Using linear gradients added visual attractiveness to the elements on the page. Smooth color transitions and gradient combinations help create an attractive and modern look.
